    <p>
      Line height allows you to change vertical spacing between lines of text
      elements
    </p>

      The technical word for CSS value which represents a distance measurements
      (such as 5px, 1em, 3rem) is Length.
      <strong>
        Note: Percentages may look like lengthy but technically they are not
        length.
      </strong>
      When an element has value defined using length (px, em, rem and so forth),
      its computed value is inherited by child elements. If line-height is
      specified with a unit, its value is calculated and that value is passed to
      children. This may lead to problems as shown here
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some properties allow unitless value</li>
      <li>Some example are line-height, z-index, and font-weight</li>
      <li>
        You can use unitless value 0 anywhere a length unit is required because
        in this case unit doesn't matter
      </li>
      <li>
        A unitless 0 can only be used for length properties such as padding,
        border, and widths. It can not be used for angular or time based values
      </li>
      <li>The line height property accept both units and unitless values</li>
      <li>It is recommended that you use unitless values for line-height</li>
    </ul>
